### Reference

`Startup.cs` is a file used in older versions of the .NET framework (such as ASP.NET Core 1.x or ASP.NET 4.x) for configuring and setting up a web application. It contains code that defines how the application will be configured and which services it will use.

It's worth noting that with the introduction of ASP.NET Core 3.0 and newer versions, the application architecture has changed, and `Startup.cs` has become part of a more general concept of application configuration and setup.
