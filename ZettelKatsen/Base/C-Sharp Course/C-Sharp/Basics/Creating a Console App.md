### Reference
1.  Creating

Creates a new directory with a c# console app files

```cs
dotnet new console -n Name
```


It will create some obj, .csproj and .cs files. Our "working" file is the .cs one. To run it we must use:

```cs
dotnet run
```

Or if we want to run it every time after we make some changes in the code:

```cs
dotnet watch run
```

2. *HINT*

To run open a code in Visual Studio just change directory in a terminal to the working folder and type (if it does not work you need to add VS Code to the PATH in the vs code app):

```cs
code .
```
